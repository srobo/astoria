Development
===========

Astoria is developed on GitHub_ and pull requests should be submitted there. If you have write access to the repository,
you optionally can develop your changes on a branch within the main repository. Alternatively, please fork the Astoria
repository and pull request from there.

If you are working on something that has an existing issue open on the Astoria repository, please ensure that you assign
the issue to yourself such that duplication of work does not accidentally occur.

Setting Up
----------

You will need the following installed on your machine:

- Python_ 3.8 or higher
- python3-pip (for package management)
- GNU Make
- poetry_
- Optionally: Udisks2, Udiskie and DBus for astdiskd
- Optionally: Mosquitto MQTT broker, although a public broker can also be used. A local broker is required for tests.
- Optionally: graphviz, required for building the Sphinx documentation

Now clone the repository from GitHub_ into a folder on your local machine.

Inside that folder, we need to tell `poetry` to install the dev dependencies: ``poetry install``

You can now enter the virtual environment using ``poetry shell`` and develop using your IDE of choice.

Testing
-------

All code must be statically typed, linted and covered in unit tests.

Integration testing is currently performed manually.

You can run all of the required tests with one command: ``make``.

Unit Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use `pytest` and `coverage.py` to do our unit testing.

Execute the test suite: ``make test``

If you wish to view the `HTML` output from `coverage.py` to help you find statements that are not covered by unit tests,
you can run the test suite in `html-cov` mode.

Execute the test suite in `html-cov` mode: ``make test-cov``

Linting
~~~~~~~

We use `flake8` and a number of extensions to ensure that our code meets the `PEP 8` standards.

Execute the linter: ``make lint``

Static Type Checking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use `mypy` to statically type check our code.

Execute Type Checking: ``make type``

Documentation
-------------

We are using `Sphinx` to generate documentation for the project.

All documentation can be found in the ``docs/`` folder.

Generate HTML Documentation: ``make docs``

Generate HTML Docs and serve locally: ``make docs-serve``

Running in Docker
-----------------

The repository includes a ``Dockerfile`` and ``docker-compose.yml`` that can be used to operate Astoria for development.

This is helpful for testing and developing applications that interface with Astoria.

Run Astoria in Docker: ``docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build``

The MQTT broker will be exposed to your host on port ``1883`` and ``9001`` (websockets).
